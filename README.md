# [Udacity] Landing page project

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

In this project I try to taste [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) <img width="20" src="https://vitejs.dev/logo.svg" alt="Vite logo"> - Next Generation Frontend Tooling. That's awsome and powerful as my personal experience ðŸ¤ª
